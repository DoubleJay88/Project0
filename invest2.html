          <h2>Basic Ingredients & Methods</h2>
          <p>
            The starting point of any stock investing has to be from its basics.
            We will touch on just the essential points without dwelling deep into
            it as these information are readily available in greater detail all
            over the internet, libraries and book stores.
            </P>

          <p>
            Generally, we can either trade a stock or invest in it. When
            trading, our primary objective is to buy and sell a stock for short
            term profits. The short term fluctuation in prices is of concern to
            us. In contrast, investing in a stock is to buy a stock and to hold
            it for long term profits and dividends payout. The end goal of both
            trading and investing are similar in that they both pursue profits
            but along different path and time frame.  For the purpose of this
            site, we will refer to investing to mean either trading or investing.
          </P>

            Now that one has decided to invest in stocks, perhaps the first
            question on ones mind would be "Where do I start?" and "Which stocks
            should I buy?". Well, first, we need to understand the methods of
            analyzing stocks of which there are two (2) methods, i.e. Fundamental
            analysis (FA) and Technical analysis (TA).  Nested within these 2
            methods is Quantitative analysis (QA) where investors calculates
            the company's financial ratios such as earnings per share or the more
            complex discounted cash flow calculations.
          </p>

          <p>FA is the method of anlysing stocks by evaluating the company's
            worth by reviewing it's financial health via financial statements,
            earnings trend and other financial information. Unlike FA, TA evaluates
            stocks by studying price trends and chart patterns on the assumption
            that past trading patterns and price movements give an insight into
            the future movement of the stock.
