            Acquiring a working knowledge of FA and TA, does not mean that
            one is fully equipped to invest successfully but it does gives
            a headstart. In reality, <span class="name"> investing is an art
            form </span> developed over a long period of time interspersed with
            success and failures, losses and profits.
          </p>
          </div>

          <div id="middle">
          <p>
            FA gives us an insight into certain sectors and companies and helps
            us to identify and target the stock that is worth investing in. TA
            helps us to time our entry and exit of a stock. This FA/TA combination
            attempts to minimize our investing risk while maximizing our return.
            <span class="name"> Any attempt to discard this approach is akin to
            gambling </span> where one might be better off going to the casino
            instead, which commands a similar risk/benefit ratio of 50:50.
          </p>
          </div>

          <div id = "bottom">
          <p>
            In reality, <span class="name"> there are no holy grail of investing
            techniques </span>. There are some who rely heavily on a strict FA
            approach. Some are solely into TA, the pure technicians. Then there
            are those who employ a combination of FA and TA. Yet there are some
            who are neither FA nor TA, relying instead on experience, hunch and
            price-volume movements and some solely on stock tips. And lastly,
            there is also an emerging group of stock investors who utilizes
            softwares to trade, an extension of the algorithm trading system
            employed by big, expert investors.

            Whichever technique one choses is fine as long as it suits one's
            style and yields positive results, measured of course by profits.
            There is really no right or wrong in stock investing but
            <span class="name"> the one crucial factor that needs to be managed
            is emotion </span> which can ultimately define failure or success.
            As humans, emotions is the most difficult to control. Only when we
            are able to discard emotions during investing can one be consistently
            successful in stock investing.
