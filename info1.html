            Stock investing is fraught with pitfalls.  It's an emotional and
            financial roller coaster ride. At times, it fills us with joy
            when it lines our pockets handsomely. There are times when it's a
            painful affair when losses are incurred. Yet there are other times when
            frustration fills the air when a missed opportunity slips by us.
            The whole array of emotions are wrapped into one during our stock
            investing journey.

            Often, stock investors trumpet their winnings . Rarely, if at all,
            do they share their experiences with losses nor the mistakes made.
            Here, in addition to the know-hows, we paint another side
            to stocks investing that is based on experience ...... the reality of
            stock investing.
